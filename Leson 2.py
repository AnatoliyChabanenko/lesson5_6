'''he greeting program.

Make a program that has your name and the current day of the week stored as separate variables and then prints a message like this:

     “Good day <name>! <day> is a perfect day to learn some python.”
Note that <name> and <day> are predefined variables in source code.

An additional bonus will be to use different string formatting methods for constructing result string.'''

name = ("Anatolii ")
lastanme = ('Çhabanenko')
dt = '17/12/2020'
print('Good day',name, dt, 'is a perfect day to learn some python' )

print(name+lastanme)
'''Using python as a calculator.

Make a program with 2 numbers saved in separate variables a and b,
 then print the result for each of the following: '''
x= 4
y= 10
plus= x+y;
m= x-y;
dil= x/y;
mi=x*y;
Exponent= x**y;
Modulus= x%y;
Floordivision= x//y;
print(Floordivision,Modulus,Exponent,mi,dil,m,plus,y,x)
